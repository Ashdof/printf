# 0x11. C - Printf Project
As part of the low level lesson using the C Programming Language, we were put into groups of two to write custom versions of the popular C standard library function, **printf().** This powerful function handles formatted output and utilises most of the concepts we have covered so far in the lesson such as *arrays, pointers, function pointers, variadic functions etc,* 

## Concepts
The concepts covered in this lesson include:
- [Group Projects](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/111)
- [Pair Programming - How To](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/121)
- [Flow Charts](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/130)
- [Technical Writing](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/225)
- [Brief on Printf Function](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/100034)
- [All About Team Projects](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/100037)

## Compilation
The code for our project was compiled using the following flags of the **GCC** compiler
` gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c `
